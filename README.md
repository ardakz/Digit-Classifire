# ## LeNet implementation with Keras and MNIST dataset
# ---
# In this notebook, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the MNIST database.

# ### 1. Load MNIST Database
# MNIST is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning.
# 
# - It has 70,000 images of hand-written digits
# - Very straight forward to download
# - Images dimensions are 28x28
# - Grayscale images
